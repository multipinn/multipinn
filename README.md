# MULTIPINN

MULTIPINN is a Python framework for **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** built on top of **PyTorch**.  
The repository contains reusable components for defining PDE-based problems, generating collocation points, configuring experiments with **Hydra**, training PINN models, and visualizing the results.

## Canonical user tutorial

The **canonical getting-started tutorial** for installation and the first run is:

- [`docs/guide/getting_started.ipynb`](docs/guide/getting_started.ipynb)
- GitHub-rendered version: `https://github.com/multipinn/multipinn/blob/main/docs/guide/getting_started.ipynb`

This README and the notebook above are intentionally synchronized.  
For all user-facing instructions, use the following common baseline:

- **Supported Python versions:** `3.8` – `3.11`
- **Recommended Python version for a new environment:** `3.10`
- **Canonical installation command:** `pip install -e .`
- `make install` is only a thin wrapper around the same command

## What MULTIPINN provides

- Fully-connected, residual, Fourier-feature, dense, factorized and other neural-network architectures
- PINN conditions for PDE residuals, boundary conditions and extra data
- Static and adaptive point generators
- Hydra-based experiment configuration
- Training loops for standard, gradual and multi-GPU workflows
- Built-in callbacks for logging, checkpoints and visualization
- Support for mesh- and graph-based workflows

## Repository structure

```text
multipinn/                     # Core library
examples/<example_name>/       # Ready-to-run problems
examples/<example_name>/configs/config.yaml
examples/<example_name>/problem.py
examples/<example_name>/run_train.py
docs/guide/getting_started.ipynb
tests/
```

The main files a user usually edits in an example are:

- `configs/config.yaml` — experiment parameters
- `problem.py` — equations, geometry and conditions
- `run_train.py` — training entry point

## System requirements

| Component | Requirement / note |
|---|---|
| Python | `>=3.8, <3.12` |
| OS | Linux, macOS, Windows |
| GPU | Optional, but strongly recommended for medium and large PDE problems |
| Browser for Plotly PNG export | Google Chrome / Chromium may be required by `kaleido` for static PNG export |
| Extra graph/mesh dependencies | Some GNN / mesh examples may require compatible PyG binary wheels, see below |

## Installation

All commands below assume that you run them **from the repository root**.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/multipinn/multipinn.git
cd multipinn
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

#### Recommended: `venv`

**Linux / macOS**
```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If `python3.10` is not available, use any supported version from `3.8` to `3.11`.

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
py -3.10 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### Alternative: `conda`

```bash
conda create -n multipinn python=3.10
conda activate multipinn
```

### 3. Install the package

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

Equivalent shorthand from the Makefile:

```bash
make install
```

## Verifying the installation

After installation, the following command should work:

```bash
python -c "import multipinn, torch; print('MULTIPINN import OK'); print('Torch:', torch.__version__)"
```

## Quick smoke test

For a short sanity check, it is convenient to run a lightweight example with reduced settings.  
The command below runs the `regression_1D` example for a few epochs and saves interactive HTML artifacts instead of PNG files:

```bash
python -m examples.regression_1D.run_train \
  trainer.num_epochs=5 \
  generator.domain_points=256 \
  visualization.grid_plot_points=256 \
  visualization.save_period=10 \
  visualization.save_mode=html \
  paths.save_dir=./artifacts_smoke/regression_1D
```

## First full example

A more representative PDE example is `poisson_2D_1C`:

```bash
python -m examples.poisson_2D_1C.run_train
```

If you want a shorter local run, override the defaults from Hydra:

```bash
python -m examples.poisson_2D_1C.run_train \
  trainer.num_epochs=100 \
  generator.domain_points=2000 \
  generator.bound_points=400 \
  visualization.grid_plot_points=1000 \
  visualization.save_period=100 \
  visualization.save_mode=html
```

## How to configure an experiment

Typical workflow:

1. Choose an example under `examples/`.
2. Adjust the parameters in `configs/config.yaml`.
3. Edit `problem.py` if you need to change equations, geometry or conditions.
4. Run the experiment via `python -m examples.<example_name>.run_train`.

Common Hydra sections in example configs:

- `problem` — problem-specific parameters
- `model` — neural-network architecture and its parameters
- `regularization` — loss balancing strategy
- `generator` — number of domain and boundary points
- `trainer` — epochs, seeds, update frequency
- `visualization` — plot density, save period, output format
- `optimizer`, `scheduler` — optimizer and learning-rate schedule
- `paths` — output directories

## Results and artifacts

Results are written to the directory defined by `paths.save_dir`.

Typical artifacts include:

- `used_config.yaml` — exact configuration used for the run
- model checkpoints (`.pth`)
- loss curves
- Plotly visualizations in `html` and/or `png`
- additional callback outputs depending on the example

If you do not need static PNG files, prefer:

```yaml
visualization:
  save_mode: html
```

This avoids extra browser requirements for Plotly image export.

## Notes for GNN and mesh examples

The base installation already includes `torch_geometric` from `requirements.txt`.  
However, some graph- and mesh-based workflows can additionally depend on PyG binary packages such as:

- `pyg_lib`
- `torch_scatter`
- `torch_sparse`
- `torch_cluster`
- `torch_spline_conv`

If an example fails with errors related to `torch_scatter`, `torch_cluster`, `knn_graph` or `radius_graph`, install the matching PyG packages for your **PyTorch** and **CUDA** combination, then rerun the example.

To check your current Torch and CUDA versions:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.version.cuda)"
```

## Developer setup

For development, install the package together with dev dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Equivalent shorthand:

```bash
make install.dev
```

Install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
make install-pre-commit
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
make test
```

## Contribution workflow

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Make a small, focused change.
4. Run tests locally.
5. Open a pull request with a concise description of the change.

When you add or change user-facing behavior, update the corresponding documentation as well — at minimum this README and `docs/guide/getting_started.ipynb`.

## Documentation policy for installation

To avoid contradictory instructions across the repository, use the following rules in all user-facing documents:

- keep the installation command as `pip install -e .`
- keep the supported Python range as `3.8–3.11`
- keep `docs/guide/getting_started.ipynb` as the main tutorial
- treat `make install` only as a shorthand for `pip install -e .`
- do not introduce alternative installation paths as the primary workflow unless they are synchronized here first
